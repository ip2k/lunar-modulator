# engines/ — the FM-1 engine platform, stage A

Swappable sound engines and effects behind one C API, built and tested on a
desktop first (docs/11 §8, stage A). Nothing here runs on the FM-1 yet. The
same sources are meant to build with JieLi's toolchain for the AC79 dev board
(stage B) and, later, the FM-1.

```bash
make -C engines                                  # build/fm1-render (+ the Schwung selftest)
engines/build/fm1-render --list                  # engines, effects and parameters (JSON)
engines/build/fm1-render --engine macro --param Model=4 \
    --note 0:57:100:1 --note 0:60:100:1 --note 0:64:100:1 \
    --fx ensemble --fx plate --fx-param Mix=0.3 \
    --seconds 3 --out chord.wav                  # A minor, "VA Pair", through two effects
python -m pytest tests/test_engine*.py           # the engine tests
```

engine's `credits` string and named without MI's trademarks
(`third_party/mutable/UPSTREAM.md`).

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `include/fm1_engine.h` | The engine API. C, no heap: the host asks `instance_size`, provides that memory (not zeroed), and the engine constructs itself in it. Typed parameters, four to a page (the FM-1 has four free parameter knobs); `fm1_param_clamp` for NaN-safe ranges; the threading contract |
| `include/fm1_mix_limiter.h` | The host's mix-bus limiter and bus guard. Twelve voices started in phase can exceed full scale; the bus holds the output under 0.98, and non-finite samples become silence |
| `src/registry.cc` | The static engine registry (tier 0 in docs/11 §5.2) |
| `src/mi_*.cc` | The Mutable-derived engines and effects |
| `src/schwung_*`, `src/sw_*.cc` | The Schwung v2 shim and one adapter per module ([schwung.md](schwung.md)) |
| `host/render.cc` | `fm1-render`: plays a note script through an engine and an effect chain in 64-frame blocks at 44,118 Hz, applies the bus limiter, writes a WAV, prints JSON |
| `test/` | The Schwung selftest and its ThreadSanitizer race harness |
| `mk/*.mk` | Build fragments, one per stream of engines |
| `sanitizers/` | Exemptions for vendored code under ASan/UBSan (below) |
| `third_party/mutable/` | Mutable Instruments code, MIT, unmodified; see `UPSTREAM.md` |
| `third_party/schwung*/` | Schwung's ABI headers and the two modules, MIT, unmodified; see each `UPSTREAM.md` |

### The renderer's test options

| Option | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `--input silence\|impulse\|noise\|sine` | The source when there is no sound engine |
| `--fx ID [--fx-param NAME=VALUE]...` | Effects, applied in order after the source |
| `--frames N`, `--rate HZ` | Host block and rate (64 and 44,118 by default) |
| `--fill BYTE` | What instance memory holds before `create`; every engine must render byte-identically from any fill |
| `--fault T[..T1]:VALUE` | Overwrite the bus after the source with `nan`, `inf` or any value, for one frame or a span, to test recovery |

## Build and checks

Build flags match the FM-1 toolchain profile: `-std=c++11 -fno-exceptions
-fno-rtti`. Vendored Mutable code also gets `-fwrapv`: Braids and stmlib
rely on wrapping signed arithmetic, as they did under ARM GCC on the modules,
and `-fwrapv` makes that defined, so no optimiser can exploit it. Keep it in
the JieLi build.

CI runs three engine jobs:

- the full test suite on Linux and macOS;
- a 32-bit (`-m32`) build that runs every engine test and prints every
  instance size, to catch pointer-size assumptions before pi32v2 does;
- ASan + UBSan over every engine test, halting on the first report.

The sanitizer run, locally (clang, because the ignorelist is a clang flag):

```bash
make -C engines clean
make -C engines CC=clang CXX=clang++ OPT=-O1 \
    EXTRA="-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -fsanitize-ignorelist=sanitizers/ignorelist.txt"
UBSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=$PWD/engines/sanitizers/ubsan.supp:halt_on_error=1 \
    python -m pytest tests/test_engine*.py
make -C engines clean
```

Each exemption in `sanitizers/` names one vendored file and the quirk it
covers: Braids' and stmlib's wrapping integer arithmetic, Plaits' six-op
`Pow2Fast` negative shift, and Plaits' LPC speech out-of-bounds read (an
upstream candidate). Our own code gets none.

## What stage A has found

- **Tuning survives the rate change.** The Mutable engines stay within
  ±5 cents at A2, A4 and A6 at 44,118 Hz without touching their sources.
  Effects written for 48 kHz get their loop gains and damping rescaled; their
  delay lengths and LFOs run 8–9 % long and slow (mi-fx.md).
- **Memory decides the voice caps.** Instance sizes, on the 64-bit desktop
  and on a 32-bit (`-m32`) build like pi32v2's [verified: CI's 32-bit job on
  PR #6]:

  | Engine | 64-bit bytes | 32-bit bytes | Why |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Shapes, 12 voices | 205,696 | 204,832 | each Braids oscillator carries ~17 KB of physical-model state |
  | PSX Verb | 134,224 | 134,208 | a fixed 128 KB work area, as upstream |
  | Sophie, 12 voices | 77,904 | 77,888 | ring delays per voice |
  | Macro Heavy, 4 voices | 68,512 | 68,304 | ~17 KB per voice (Particle and String arenas) |
  | Plate | 65,648 | 65,632 | 32,768 16-bit delay words, as Rings |
  | Macro, 12 voices | 30,496 | 17,616 | mostly pointer tables, which halve on 32-bit |
  | Diffuse | 18,848 | 18,848 | |
  | Six-Op FM, 8 voices | 11,304 | 9,572 | |
  | Ensemble | 4,704 | 4,704 | |

  The stock layout leaves a gap of 387,924 bytes, part of it stock's heap
  (docs/11 §2, [inferred]). Most engine-plus-two-effects chains fit in it;
  Shapes at 12 voices takes more than half on its own, and Shapes with PSX
  Verb and Plate (404,672 bytes on 32-bit) does not fit. Shapes needs a lower cap on the
  FM-1, or its physical-model shapes split into a smaller engine.
- **Host contracts, now tested for every engine** (tests/test_engine_host.py):
  output does not depend on instance memory's prior contents; any
  parameter value, NaN included, is survived; the bus limiter recovers from
  NaN, infinities and huge samples. The limiter used to stop limiting for
  good after one NaN, and NaN parameters reached undefined float-to-int
  conversions in the first engines; both are fixed.
- **Schwung modules port through the shim unchanged**, with three
  conditions the API now states: a module's init runs once (a second init
  rewrote tables another instance was rendering through), int16 effects need
  headroom so overs reach the limiter instead of clipping, and `atof`/`strtod`
  go to a heap-free parser because newlib's can allocate (schwung.md).
- **Upstream bugs and quirks**, all worked around in our wrappers with the
  vendored files unmodified: Plaits' `WavetableEngine` arena overrun, the
  LPC speech out-of-bounds read, Six-Op's divide by zero on zero-length
  renders, and more (plaits-heavy.md, `notes/upstream-candidates.md`).
- **Relative cost, desktop only** (Apple M1 Max, all voices sounding, share
  of the 1.451 ms block):

  | Engine | Share of block |
  | --- | --- |
  | Macro, most models (12 voices) | 1.0–1.8 % |
  | Macro, 2-op FM (12) | 4.9 % |
  | Macro Heavy, most models (4) | 0.5–0.9 % |
  | Macro Heavy, Particle (4) | 1.75 % |
  | Six-Op FM (8) | 0.75 % |
  | Shapes (12) | 0.2–0.6 % |
  | Each Mutable effect | 0.03–0.06 % |

  pi32v2 is a much narrower core and these figures do not transfer; stage B
  measures the real ones. They do rank the engines for the voice caps.

## Open questions and next steps

- **Six-Op FM's patch names** include third-party trademarks and a person's
  name, and the banks' origin is not stated upstream. Harmless for a
  personal build; for anything distributed, rename or drop them
  (plaits-heavy.md, "The patch data").
- **Shapes' memory:** a voice cap for the FM-1 build, or a split.
- **Host features the streams asked for:** timed parameter changes
  (`--param-at`), an active-voice diagnostic so voice freeing can be tested
  without timing, parameter smoothing (host or engine), and a reset call so
  effects can drop their tails without re-creating a 64 KB instance.
- **Stage B**, on the JL-AC79 dev board: the same sources under JieLi's
  clang, real cycle counts, and whether pi32v2's FPU traps on divide by zero
  or handles subnormals slowly (several upstream quirks rely on it not
  trapping).
