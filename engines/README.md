# engines/ — the FM-1 engine platform, stage A

Swappable sound engines and effects behind one C API, built and tested on a
desktop first (docs/11 §8, stage A). Nothing here runs on the FM-1 yet. The
same sources are meant to build with JieLi's toolchain for the AC79 dev board
(stage B) and, later, the FM-1.

```bash
make -C engines                                  # build/fm1-render (+ the Schwung selftest)
engines/build/fm1-render --list                  # engines, effects, parameters and enum names (JSON)
engines/build/fm1-render --engine macro --param Model=4 \
    --note 0:57:100:1 --note 0:60:100:1 --note 0:64:100:1 \
    --fx ensemble --fx plate --fx-param Mix=0.3 \
    --seconds 3 --out chord.wav                  # A minor, "VA Pair", through two effects
python -m pytest tests/test_engine*.py           # the engine tests
```

engine's `credits` string and named without MI's trademarks
(`third_party/mutable/UPSTREAM.md`).

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `include/fm1_engine.h` | The engine API. C, no heap: the host asks `instance_size`, provides that memory (not zeroed), and the engine constructs itself in it. Typed parameters, four to a page (the FM-1 has four free parameter knobs); `fm1_param_clamp` for NaN-safe ranges; the threading contract |
| `mod/` | Modulation primitives: an LFO, a Peaks-style envelope, slew, S&H, a Turing register and a tick clock divider. Heap-free C99, not wired in yet ([mod/README.md](mod/README.md)) |
| `include/fm1_seq.h`, `seq/` | The sequencer core: a heap-free C99 port of Movy's sequencer, with 4–8 routed tracks ([seq.md](seq.md), docs/13) |
| `include/fm1_mix_limiter.h` | The host's mix-bus limiter and bus guard. Twelve voices started in phase can exceed full scale; the bus holds the output under 0.98, and non-finite samples become silence |
| `src/registry.cc` | The static engine registry (tier 0 in docs/11 §5.2) |
| `src/mi_*.cc` | The Mutable-derived engines and effects |
| `src/schwung_*`, `src/sw_*.cc` | The Schwung v2 shim and one adapter per module ([schwung.md](schwung.md)) |
| `host/render.cc` | `fm1-render`: plays a note script through an engine and an effect chain in 64-frame blocks at 44,118 Hz, applies the bus limiter, writes a WAV, prints JSON |
| `test/` | The reference renderers (`fm1-ref-plaits`, `fm1-ref-braids-fx`: upstream Mutable code driven as the modules drive it), the Schwung selftest and its ThreadSanitizer race harness |
| `mk/*.mk` | Build fragments, one per stream of engines |
| `sanitizers/` | Exemptions for vendored code under ASan/UBSan (below) |
| `third_party/mutable/` | Mutable Instruments code, MIT, unmodified; see `UPSTREAM.md` |
| `third_party/schwung*/` | Schwung's ABI headers and the two modules, MIT, unmodified; see each `UPSTREAM.md` |

### The renderer's test options

| Option | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `--input silence\|impulse\|noise\|sine` | The source when there is no sound engine |
| `--fx ID [--fx-param NAME=VALUE]...` | Effects, applied in order after the source |
| `--frames N`, `--rate HZ` | Host block and rate (64 and 44,118 by default) |
| `--bend T:SEMITONES` | A pitch-bend event (finite, within ±48), at a block boundary like notes |
| `--param-at T:NAME=VALUE` | Turn a sound engine's parameter during the render |
| `--fill BYTE` | What instance memory holds before `create`; every engine must render byte-identically from any fill |
| `--fault T[..T1]:VALUE` | Overwrite the bus after the source with `nan`, `inf` or any value, for one frame or a span, to test recovery |

## Build and checks

Build flags match the FM-1 toolchain profile: `-std=c++11 -fno-exceptions
-fno-rtti`. Vendored Mutable code also gets `-fwrapv`: Braids and stmlib
rely on wrapping signed arithmetic, as they did under ARM GCC on the modules,
and `-fwrapv` makes that defined, so no optimiser can exploit it. Keep it in
the JieLi build.

CI runs three engine jobs:

- the full test suite on Linux and macOS;
- a 32-bit (`-m32`) build that runs every engine test and prints every
  instance size, to catch pointer-size assumptions before pi32v2 does;
- ASan + UBSan over every engine test, halting on the first report.

The sanitizer run, locally (clang, because the ignorelist is a clang flag):

```bash
make -C engines clean
make -C engines CC=clang CXX=clang++ OPT=-O1 \
    EXTRA="-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -fsanitize-ignorelist=sanitizers/ignorelist.txt"
UBSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=$PWD/engines/sanitizers/ubsan.supp:halt_on_error=1 \
    python -m pytest tests/test_engine*.py
make -C engines clean
```

Each exemption in `sanitizers/` names one vendored file and the quirk it
covers: Braids' and stmlib's wrapping integer arithmetic, Plaits' six-op
`Pow2Fast` negative shift, and Plaits' LPC speech out-of-bounds read (an
upstream candidate). Our own code gets none.

## What stage A has found

- **Tuning survives the rate change.** The Mutable engines stay within
  ±5 cents at A2, A4 and A6 at 44,118 Hz without touching their sources.
  Effects written for 48 kHz get their loop gains and damping rescaled; their
  delay lengths and LFOs run 8–9 % long and slow (mi-fx.md).
- **Memory decides the voice caps.** Instance sizes, on the 64-bit desktop
  and on a 32-bit (`-m32`) build like pi32v2's [verified: CI's 32-bit job on
  PR #6]:

  | Engine | 64-bit bytes | 32-bit bytes | Why |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Shapes, 12 voices | 207,080 | 206,212 | each Braids oscillator carries ~17 KB of physical-model state |
  | PSX Verb | 134,224 | 134,208 | a fixed 128 KB work area, as upstream |
  | Sophie, 12 voices | 77,904 | 77,888 | ring delays per voice |
  | Macro Heavy, 4 voices | 71,088 | 70,880 | ~17 KB per voice (Particle and String arenas) |
  | Plate | 65,648 | 65,632 | 32,768 16-bit delay words, as Rings |
  | Macro, 12 voices | 31,728 | 18,864 | mostly pointer tables, which halve on 32-bit |
  | Diffuse | 18,848 | 18,848 | |
  | Six-Op FM, 8 voices | 12,528 | 10,796 | |
  | Ensemble | 4,704 | 4,704 | |

  The 32-bit figures include the native-rate resamplers (about 1.3 KB each)
  [verified: CI's 32-bit job on PR #12].

  The stock layout leaves a gap of 387,924 bytes, part of it stock's heap
  (docs/11 §2, [inferred]). Most engine-plus-two-effects chains fit in it;
  Shapes at 12 voices takes more than half on its own, and Shapes with PSX
  Verb and Plate (404,672 bytes on 32-bit) does not fit. Shapes needs a lower cap on the
  FM-1, or its physical-model shapes split into a smaller engine.
- **Host contracts, now tested for every engine** (tests/test_engine_host.py):
  output does not depend on instance memory's prior contents; any
  parameter value, NaN included, is survived; the bus limiter recovers from
  NaN, infinities and huge samples. The limiter used to stop limiting for
  good after one NaN, and NaN parameters reached undefined float-to-int
  conversions in the first engines; both are fixed.
- **Schwung modules port through the shim unchanged**, with three
  conditions the API now states: a module's init runs once (a second init
  rewrote tables another instance was rendering through), int16 effects need
  headroom so overs reach the limiter instead of clipping, and `atof`/`strtod`
  go to a heap-free parser because newlib's can allocate (schwung.md).
- **Upstream bugs and quirks**, all worked around in our wrappers with the
  vendored files unmodified: Plaits' `WavetableEngine` arena overrun, the
  LPC speech out-of-bounds read, Six-Op's divide by zero on zero-length
  renders, and more (plaits-heavy.md, `notes/upstream-candidates.md`).
- **Relative cost, desktop only** (Apple M1 Max, all voices sounding, share
  of the 1.451 ms block):

  | Engine | Share of block |
  | --- | --- |
  | Macro, most models (12 voices) | 1.0–1.8 % |
  | Macro, 2-op FM (12) | 4.9 % |
  | Macro Heavy, most models (4) | 0.5–0.9 % |
  | Macro Heavy, Particle (4) | 1.75 % |
  | Six-Op FM (8) | 0.75 % |
  | Shapes (12) | 0.2–0.6 % |
  | Each Mutable effect | 0.03–0.06 % |

  pi32v2 is a much narrower core and these figures do not transfer; stage B
  measures the real ones. They do rank the engines for the voice caps.

## The exit test: renders against upstream

Stage A's exit test (docs/11 §8) is that our engines render what upstream
Mutable code renders, within a tolerance. Two reference renderers compile the
vendored upstream code on its own and drive it as the modules' firmware does:
`plaits::Voice` every 12 samples at 47,872 Hz, and `braids::MacroOscillator`
every 24 samples at 96 kHz, with Rings' reverb and Plaits' ensemble and
diffuser at their native rates. The tests render both sides and compare
[verified: tests/test_engines_reference_*.py, 427 tests on 2026-10-01]:

| Engine | At the upstream rate | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Macro, Macro Heavy (21 of Plaits' 24 slots) | sample for sample, to within fm1-render's 16-bit rounding (-87 to -88.5 dBFS); the random engines too, since both sides seed stmlib's generator alike | [reference-plaits.md](reference-plaits.md) |
| Six-Op FM (3 slots) | close, not identical: correlation ≥ 0.98, from its 16-sample envelope blocks against upstream's staggered 24-sample chunks | [reference-plaits.md](reference-plaits.md) |
| Shapes (47 shapes) | within 0.52 LSB, physical models and random shapes included | [reference-braids-fx.md](reference-braids-fx.md) |
| Plate, Ensemble, Diffuse | within 0.5 LSB | [reference-braids-fx.md](reference-braids-fx.md) |

The comparison checks our wrappers. The engine DSP is the same object code on
both sides, so a test pins the 129 vendored Plaits files it compiles by hash.
Reviewers mutation-tested both lanes: 50 of 51 Plaits mutants and all but one
Braids/effects mutant now fail a test. The one survivor is a Six-Op
envelope block change inside the intended tolerance; the other, Shapes
ignoring pitch bend, fails the bend tests since the renderer gained `--bend`.

It found one real bug: **Shapes split each 64-frame host block into 24 + 24 +
16** while Braids only ever renders 24. Twenty-two shapes drifted (Bell and
Drum decayed 9–16 % fast, Comb, Vowel and Wave Line glitched), output depended
on the host's block size, and 11 shapes crashed on odd-sized calls (a heap
overflow under ASan). Shapes now renders exactly 24-sample blocks and buffers
them, as Macro does with 12.

**Native rates (2026-10-01, the owner's decision).** The Mutable engines
now run at their modules' own rates whatever the host's rate: Shapes runs
Braids at 96 kHz, and Macro, Macro Heavy and Six-Op run Plaits at
47,872.34 Hz. Each engine resamples its mix once with `fm1_resampler.h`
([resampler.md](resampler.md)), which passes samples through bit for bit
when the rates are equal. At the FM-1's 44,118 Hz this removed every
difference pitch-only correction had left: Plaits' envelopes ran 8.5 % long,
Braids' struck shapes rang 1.6–2.8 times as long, TIMBRE-derived rates ran
low (the noise clock by 1.41 semitones), and the string model read -9.5 cents
at A2. Now, against upstream rendered at its own rate and resampled the same
way [verified: tests/test_engines_reference_*.py]:
- 20 of the 21 Macro and Macro Heavy slots match byte for byte, and Chiptune
  to 1 LSB;
- Six-Op matches closely (correlation ≥ 0.988);
- all 47 shapes match within 0.55 LSB, and struck decays at 0.9995–1.006 of
  upstream.

The cost is CPU: Shapes takes 2.5–3× its old time and the Plaits engines
1.1–1.5× (desktop), mostly the extra samples plus about 70–114
multiply-adds per output for the resampler. Hosts above an engine's native
rate are refused. The effects still rescale their loop gains and damping,
keeping decay within 3–4 %.

## Open questions and next steps

- **Six-Op FM's patch data** has no stated origin upstream. The 23 patch
  names that are trademarks or a person's name are shown under names of our
  own; `-DFM1_SIXOP_ORIGINAL_NAMES` shows the stored ones in a personal build
  (plaits-heavy.md, "The patch data"). The data itself still needs review
  before anything commercial.
- **Shapes' memory:** 207 KB for 12 voices. A voice cap for the FM-1 build,
  or a split of the physical-model shapes.
- **Resampler cost on pi32v2:** the stronger second stage costs about 114
  multiply-adds per output; the cheaper half-band version (about 70, with
  18–22 kHz unprotected) is commit `f12448c`. The owner's decision
  (2026-10-01): keep Braids at 96 kHz with the full resampler, and decide
  again once stage B measures the cost on pi32v2. Until then two cheaper
  variants stay candidates for build options: the half-band second stage,
  and Braids at twice the host rate (88,236 Hz) with only a half-band
  decimator (about 18 multiply-adds, but Braids' timing about 8 % off).
- **Effects at native rates:** not done. Each effect would need a resampler
  on its input and output; the measured gap is small (decay within 3–4 %,
  delays 8.5 % long).
- **Six-Op's polarity** is inverted relative to Macro and Macro Heavy
  against the same upstream output words. Harmless alone; worth making
  consistent before engines are layered or crossfaded.
- **Host features the streams asked for:** a random seed (`--seed`; stmlib's
  generator is a global in vendored code, so the host cannot seed it without
  depending on one library), an active-voice diagnostic so voice freeing can be tested
  without timing, parameter smoothing (host or engine), and a reset call so
  effects can drop their tails without re-creating a 64 KB instance. Also a
  per-file SHA-256 manifest from `vendor.py`, so a test can pin the whole
  vendored tree rather than the files one lane compiles.
- **Stage B**, on the JL-AC79 dev board: the same sources under JieLi's
  clang, real cycle counts, and whether pi32v2's FPU traps on divide by zero
  or handles subnormals slowly (several upstream quirks rely on it not
  trapping).
