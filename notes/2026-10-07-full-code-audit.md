# Full code audit — 2026-10-07

Status: **in progress; no completion claim yet**. Device firmware implementation remains paused pending this audit and review.

## Scope and pinned source variants

- Baseline worktree commit: `d7111a985d5d6262767d6af49ba26caf0e1b9453`.
- Fetched `origin/main`: `64209e3c08222ada0eb61afcaef89e909ae07955`.
- Fetched editor feature head: `861b725bbe4efadb2d56400853a03b78f695f4cf`.
- The audit branch contains a post-main 16-file hardware-recovery/provenance delta. Review those files as present without executing device tools.
- The editor branch is a separate source variant. Review its diff and complete modified-file context; do not merge it into this branch.
- File-by-file progress is recorded in [the coverage ledger](2026-10-07-full-code-audit-coverage.md). No generated firmware or hardware command is authorized by this audit task.

## Method

Read all first-party tracked source and build files in batches; review call graphs, resource ownership/lifetime, concurrency, input validation, integer bounds, build/link and runtime boundaries, test coverage, tool safety, vendored integration/provenance/licensing, generated artifacts, obsolete paths, and dead-code/refactor candidates. Review vendored bulk by explicit tier and document every exclusion. Search results and earlier cleanup candidates are leads only, not audit evidence. Findings require file/line, reachable scenario, evidence, severity, and confidence; distinguish confirmed defects from hypotheses and optional refactors.

## Progress and findings

Audit batches and findings will be appended here with the ledger updated in the same checkpoint. No findings have been validated yet.
